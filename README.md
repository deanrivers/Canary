<h2>Assumptions made:</h2><br>
1. There will be one type of measurement made for each new device with a randomly generated value. In the real world, devices should be detected when "adding" a device instead of being manually entered by the user with measurements and the type of device.<br>

<i>P.S... I created my own API endpoint to demonstrate POST (something is fishy which I am looking into).</i>
