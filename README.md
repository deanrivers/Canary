<h2>In order to run this application please do the following:</h2><br>
1. In the root directory, run "npm install" to install all dependencies for this project.<br>
2. In the root directory of this project, run the command "node server.js"<br>
3. In the root directory of this project, run the command "npm start"<br>

The two above steps should be done in two seperate terminals so they can run simultaneously.<br>

<h2>Assumptions made:</h2><br>
1. There will be one type of measurement made for each new device with a randomly generated value. In the real world, devices should be detected when "adding" a device instead of being manually entered by the user with measurements and the type of device.<br>
<br>

P.S... I created my own API endpoint to demonstrate POST.
